<h1 style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"> :star2: Special :star2: </h1>
My own special scoop bucket containing specific special app manifests that I need

To add run `scoop bucket add special https://github.com/EscWasTaken/scoop-special`

Note: I am using the unlicense here since it is what is used on the scoop extras bucket and I don't really want to get in trouble for copying and editing manifests
